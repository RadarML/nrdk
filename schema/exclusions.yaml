# Exclusions for velocity estimation, by index (`_fusion/indices.npz`).
# The likely reason for SLAM failure is listed for each exclusion.
#
# This list was compiled by first fine-tuning a `tiny` radar transformer on
# all of the training and evaluation data (with `tiny/base` as the base model).
# The resulting model was applied to all training and evaluation data, and any
# significant mismatches between the model's fit and actual velocities flagged
# as anomalies. Each anomaly was manually inspected and verified, before being
# added to the list below.
#
# These anomalies fall into the following categories:
#
# bridge: bridges tend to only include repetitive features (guardrails, etc),
#   with the most dominant non-repetitive features (cars, etc) also being
#   dynamic.
# tunnel: same cause as a bridge. also includes "tunnel-like" areas which are
#   not technically tunnels, but nevertheless feature parallel walls with no
#   lidar features (other than highly dynamic vehicles).
# empty: the area within the Lidar's practical range is mostly empty,
#   or otherwise lacking in strong features.
# warmup: Cartographer is unstable at initialization. While this should be
#   cropped out, particularly long periods of instability at warmup are
#   manually excluded.
# unknown: it's not clear why SLAM failed, but the reported movement patterns
#   are not realistically possible.
