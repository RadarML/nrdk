The Neural Radar Development Kit (NRDK) is an open-source and MIT-licensed Python library and framework for developing, training, and evaluating machine learning models on radar spectrum and multimodal sensor data.

Built around typed, high modular interfaces, the NRDK is designed to reduce the barrier of entry to learning on spectrum via out-of-the-box reference implementations for [red-rover](https://radarml.github.io/red-rover/) data and the [I/Q-1M Dataset](https://radarml.github.io/red-rover/iq1m/), while also providing an easy path towards customization and extensions for other radar and data collection systems.
